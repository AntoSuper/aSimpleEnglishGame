        <p><b><span lang="EN-US">The Fun They Had</span></b></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Isaac Asimov
        (1920-1992)</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie even wrote about it that
        night in her diary. On the page headed May 17, 2155, she wrote, Today Tommy
        found a real book!</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">It was a very old book. Margie&apos;s
        grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him
        that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">They turned the pages, which were
        yellow and crankily, and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still
        instead of moving the way they were supposed to - on a screen, you know. And
        then, when they turned back to the page before, it had the same words on it
        that it had had when they read it the first time.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Gee, said Tommy, what a waste. When
        you&apos;re though with the book, you just throw it away, I guess. Our television screen
        must have had a million books on it and it&apos;s good for plenty more. I wouldn&apos;t
        throw it away.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Same with mine, said Margie. She was
        eleven and hadn&apos;t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had. He was thirteen. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">She said, Where did you find it?</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">In my house. He pointed without
        looking, because he was busy reading. In the attic.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">What&apos;s it about?</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">School.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie was scornful. School? What&apos;s
        there to write about school? I hate school. Margie had always hated school, but
        now she hated it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been giving her
        test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her
        mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County Inspector. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">He was a round little man with a red
        face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled at her and gave
        her an apple, then took the teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn&apos;t know
        how to put it together again, but he knew how all right and, after an hour or
        so, there it was again, large and black and ugly with a big screen on which all
        the lessons were shown and the questions were asked. That wasn&apos;t so bad. The
        part she hated the most was the slot where she had to put homework and test
        papers. She always had to write them out in a punch code they made her learn when
        she was six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no
        time. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">The inspector had smiled after he
        was finished and patted her head. He said to her mother, It&apos;s not the little
        girl&apos;s fault, Mrs. Jones. I think the geography sector was geared a little too
        quick. Those things happen sometimes. I&apos;ve slowed it up to an average ten-year
        level. Actually, the over-all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory.
        And he patted Margie&apos;s head again. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie was disappointed. She had
        been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether. They had once taken
        Tommy&apos;s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked
        out completely. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">So she said to Tommy, Why would
        anyone write about school?</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Tommy looked at her with very superior
        eyes. Because it&apos;s not our kind of school, stupid. This is the old kind of
        school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie was hurt. Well, I don&apos;t know
        what kind of school they had all that time ago. She read the book over his
        shoulder for a while, then said, Anyway, they had a teacher.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Sure they had a teacher, but it
        wasn&apos;s a regular teacher. It was a man.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">A man. How could a man be a teacher?
        </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Well, he just told the boys and
        girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">A man isn&apos;t smart enough.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Sure he is. My father knows as much
        as my teacher.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">He can&apos;t. A man can&apos;t know as much
        as a teacher. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">He knows almost as much I betcha.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie wasn&apos;t prepared to dispute
        that. She said, I wouldn&apos;t want a strange man in my house to teach me.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Tommy screamed with laughter. You
        don&apos;t know much, Margie. The teachers didn&apos;t live in the house. They had a
        special building and all the kids went there.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">And all the kids learned the same
        thing?</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Sure, if they were the same age.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">But my mother says a teacher has to
        be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid
        has to be taught differently.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Just the same, they didn&apos;t do it
        that way then. If you don&apos;t like it, you don&apos;t have to read the book.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">I didn&apos;t say I didn&apos;t like it,
        Margie said quickly. She wanted to read about those funny schools.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">They weren&apos;t nearly half finished
        when Margie&apos;s mother called, Margie! School!</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie looked up. Not yet, mamma.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Now, said Mrs. Jones. And it&apos;s
        probably time for Tommy, too. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie said to Tommy, Can I read the
        book some more with you after school?</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Maybe, he said, nonchalantly. He
        walked away whistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie went to the schoolroom. It
        was right next to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting
        for her. It was always on at the same time every day except for Saturday and
        Sunday, because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at
        regular hours. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">The screen was lit up, and it said:
        Today&apos;s arithmetical lesson is on the addition of proper fractions. Please
        insert yesterday&apos;s homework in the proper slot. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie did so with a sigh. She was
        thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather&apos;s grandfather was
        a boy. All the kids from the whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting in
        the school yard, sitting together in the schoolroom, going home together at the
        end of the day. They learned the same things so they could help one another on
        the homework and talk about it.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">And the teachers were peopleâ€¦</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">The mechanical teacher was flashing
        on the screen. When we add the fractions &frac12; and &frac14; .</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-US">Margie was thinking about how the
        kids must have loved it in the old days. She was thinking about the fun they
        had. </span></p>
